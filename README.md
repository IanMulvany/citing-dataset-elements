Citing dataset elements
========

This repo contains a csv file that summarises guidance provided by a number of organisations around what features or information should be provided for citing data. By inferring across these sources we hope to find the most commonly suggested features that can be useful for citing data. We hope to use this resource to form the basis of a recommendation on how to use JATS to cite data, and there is a piece of work remaining 

This work was produced as a part of the NISO data-citation workshop that took place in London in June 2014.
